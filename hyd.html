        <h3>Project Description</h3>

        <p>
            The Hyderabad House Price Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application
            designed to estimate residential property prices in Hyderabad based on multiple input
            features. The project aims to assist users, buyers, and real estate professionals in
            making informed decisions using data-driven insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            The backend of the application is developed using <strong>Python and Flask</strong>,
            where data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model inference are performed.
            A regression-based machine learning model predicts house prices based on user inputs
            such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors.
        </p>

        <p>
            During model development, extensive <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>
            was carried out to understand price trends, location-based variations, and feature
            importance. Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables,
            and feature scaling were applied to improve prediction accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The frontend is built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to provide a
            responsive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily enter property details
            through the input form, which is validated before being sent to the Flask backend.
        </p>

        <p>
            After processing the inputs, the predicted house price is displayed clearly on the
            result page, making the system accessible even to non-technical users. This project
            demonstrates the practical application of <strong>machine learning in real estate
            price estimation</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this project showcases an end-to-end implementation of
            <strong>data analysis, machine learning, Flask web development, and frontend design</strong>,
            highlighting real-world problem-solving and predictive modeling skills.
