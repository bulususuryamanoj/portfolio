        <h3>Project Description</h3>

        <p>
            The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to
            predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on key medical and lifestyle
            parameters. The system aims to support early diagnosis and promote preventive healthcare
            through data-driven insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            The backend of the application is developed using <strong>Python and Flask</strong>,
            where data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model inference
            are performed. A classification-based machine learning model analyzes inputs such as
            glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level, and other health indicators
            to predict diabetes risk.
        </p>

        <p>
            During model development, detailed <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> was
            conducted to understand feature distributions, correlations, and important predictors
            of diabetes. Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling
            techniques were applied to improve model accuracy and robustness.
        </p>

        <p>
            The frontend is built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to provide a
            responsive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily enter their medical details
            through a structured input form, with validation ensuring accurate and reliable data
            submission.
        </p>

        <p>
            After processing the inputs, the system displays the predicted diabetes status clearly
            on the result page, making the output understandable even for non-technical users.
            This project demonstrates the practical application of
            <strong>machine learning in healthcare diagnosis</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this project showcases an end-to-end implementation of
            <strong>data analysis, machine learning, Flask web development, and frontend design</strong>,
            highlighting real-world healthcare problem-solving skills.
